# MultifunctionCalculator
This file includes the design of a multifunction calculator which does 8 different arithmetic and logic operations using ALU logic. Implement on Basys3 FPGA board.

Input A : Swithes 15 to 10

Operation Selection : Swithes 9 to 7

Input B : Swithes 5 to 0

Leds 5 to 0 : Operation Output (6 bit), LED6 : Carry or Borrow Flag
